code for the Marshal is primarily copied from the wired button module. Some inputs and outputs will need to be changed.

I will be replacing the RS485 tasks with a wireless xbee version of them.

The wired init may need to be changed to perform any initialization that the xbee needs, if not then we can remove it.

WBM task will be renamed to MAR task, but should be mostly the same.

USART0 no longer requires a MUTEX, as far as I can tell.
