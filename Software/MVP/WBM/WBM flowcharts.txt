Message Processing______________________________________________________________________________
Intertask messages to DS take the form of two bytes for now, following this format:
Byte 0 = command/identifier, Byte 1 = data/state

commands and data:

0x05, <index> = check device table, used when a new device is added to the table to get the DS task to process it and mark as relevant or not.

Other commands may be device dependent, for a controller such as this
0x04, <button> = button pressed, sent from the button task when a button has been pressed.

outbound commands from task:
to indicator out:
<indicator>,<state> = indicators 1 to 3 and 0xff for all. 0 for off, 1 for solid on, 2 for blink.


Interdevice messages have a third byte in them to differentiate from intertask, the third byte might be padding, or additional information.

0x05 typically indicates that something is from the comms-in task within a device. but outside of a device it is reserved for pings only

inbound messages:
0x05, <index>, <data> = <data> from the device at <index>. used for routine confirmation and communication messages between controllers and lights

outbound messages:
messages to the comms out task are a bit different, the command is attached to the end of the message so it can easily be stripped away when the message is forwarded.
an inter-device message from a controller DS task to a light through the comms out task may look like:
<colour>, <command>, <detail>. where the commands are specified in the documents for the comms out tasks

Colour lockouts are set when a safety colour is requested, the lockout is only released once all lights confirm the colour change.
A controller will not try to override a lockout colour until all lights have confirmed the colour.
A controller will send a message to other controllers on the same channel, which will set lockouts when appropriate.
(indicators will flash to indicate a change of colour, cannot change to green if yellow is still flashing)

Colour track is used to control output messaging. Lights will also lockout internally and must be released by a confirmation message from a controller.
Controllers will work together, which may cause some network spam in this simplified case, but
