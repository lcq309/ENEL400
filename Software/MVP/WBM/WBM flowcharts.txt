Intertask messages to DS take the form of two bytes for now, following this format:
Byte 0 = command/identifier, Byte 1 = data/state

commands and data:

0x05, <index> = check device table, used when a new device is added to the table to get the DS task to process it and mark as relevant or not.

Other commands may be device dependent, for a controller such as this
0x04, <button> = button pressed, sent from the button task when a button has been pressed.

outbound commands from task:
to indicator out:
<indicator>,<state> = indicators 1 to 3 and 0xff for all. 0 for off, 1 for solid on, 2 for blink.
