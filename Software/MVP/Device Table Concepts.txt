Global Device Table concept:

The global device table could be an array of structs including:
position in array is used internally to refer to a device, so when a new device is added to the table by the RS485_IN task it will pass the table entry number to device specific to ask it to check.
If the table requires MUTEX protection, then there may need to be a task holding an input buffer so that the RS485_IN task doesn't get stuck waiting for table access.

Structure can be defined as:
8 bytes Wireless Address
1 byte Wired Address
1 byte Channel
1 byte Device Type
1 byte flags - first bit indicates relevance, other 7 can be used by device specific for whatever

if we make the table sized to fit 255 devices, a total of 3060 bytes of RAM will be dedicated to the table, may need to adjust the config of FreeRTOS to ensure it will fit.

The coordinator uses a much simpler device table, as it is only used to target pings from the round robin task.

device types listing:
0 - reserved
1 - generic light controller
2 - generic light
3 - reserved as end delimiter
5 - reserved for wired pings only
