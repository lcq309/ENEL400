    \section{Introduction}
        The Master Controller will be the most complex single part of the entire
         project, the purpose of the master controller is to act as a gateway
         between the wired and wireless networks, display errors, provide a
         power supply for wired devices, and provide a simple menu for viewing 
         devices on the network.
