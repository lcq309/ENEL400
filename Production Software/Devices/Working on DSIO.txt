Device Specific I/O should define:
- Any tasks that relate to physical inputs and outputs
- interrupts related to inputs and outputs (except for primary communications interrupts)
- functions for toggling any inputs and outputs

Task names should be related to their function.

RS485TR needs to be defined in here for devices that are on the wired network
