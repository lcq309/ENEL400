Device Specific I/O should define:
- Any tasks that relate to physical inputs and outputs
- interrupts related to inputs and outputs (except for primary communications interrupts)
- functions for toggling any inputs and outputs

Task names should be related to their function.

RS485TR needs to be defined in here for devices that are on the wired network

To coordinate flashing and blinking, I could use a software timer with a 50 tick period. flashing could toggle every 50ms, while blinking could toggle every 5 cycles.
I could use a separate one-shot timer to provide software debouncing for inputs.
